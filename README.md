This is technical challenge for Welhome.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The base URL is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Postman

There is a folder named ```postman```, that contains requests to be used with this backend.

## Technical decisions

#### SCREAMING Architecture

I chose to use the SCREAMING architecture because I believe it communicates what the project does visually and is superior to the classic model of controller folders, models, services, etc.

#### Database

The chose database was SQLite because it is lightweighted and very appropriated to the requirements.
